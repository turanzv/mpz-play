## üìò Exercise Summary: 02 - Finite Fields and Share Conversion

### üß† Goal

Demonstrate the use of **share conversion techniques** in finite fields using `mpz`. The exercise shows how to:
- Convert a shared additive value into a shared multiplicative value.
- Then convert it back to an additive form.
- Verify correctness by comparing the initial and final additive shares.

This involves:
- OLE-based oblivious transfer.
- Additive and multiplicative share representations.
- Cross-party consistency checks via message exchange.

### ‚ÑπÔ∏è Background Concepts

#### üîÅ What is OLE?

**Oblivious Linear Evaluation (OLE)** is a cryptographic primitive that lets one party (the sender) provide a function of the form `f(x) = ax + b` without revealing `a` or `b`, and the other party (the receiver) learn `f(x)` for their input `x`, without revealing `x`. It's used here as the secure mechanism for performing arithmetic over secret shares.

#### ‚ûï vs ‚úñÔ∏è Additive and Multiplicative Shares

- **Additive Shares**: A value `v` is split into `v = a + b`, where `a` and `b` are random shares known to each party. Addition of shared values is easy.
- **Multiplicative Shares**: A value `v` is represented as `v = a * b`, which supports efficient multiplication of shared secrets.

üîÑ **Conversion is necessary** because different computations (like sums and products) are more efficient in different representations. Secure protocols often switch between these forms to optimize performance and security.

### üîß Setup & Share Conversion Flow

#### 1. Initialize OLE (Oblivious Linear Evaluation)
```rust
let base = OLESender::setup(BaseSenderConfig::default(), executor).await.unwrap();
let conv = ShareConversionSender::new(base);
```
- Uses a Chou-Orlandi-based sender or receiver as the base.
- Wraps it to enable share conversion routines.

#### 2. Convert Additive ‚Üí Multiplicative
```rust
let (share_sender, share_receiver) = AdditiveToMultiplicative::convert(&conv, share).await.unwrap();
```
- Securely transforms the shared value into a multiplicative format using the OLE backend.

#### 3. Convert Multiplicative ‚Üí Additive
```rust
let (new_share_sender, new_share_receiver) = MultiplicativeToAdditive::convert(&conv, share).await.unwrap();
```

#### 4. Validate Equality
- Each party sends the missing share piece to the other.
- Locally reconstruct and compare to confirm the round-trip transformation succeeded.

### üîç Highlights
- Demonstrates key concepts in secure computation over finite fields:
 - Additive and multiplicative secret sharing.
 - Use of OLE for algebraic transformations without leaking values.
- Share conversion is fundamental for switching between arithmetic representations during secure computation.
- The conversion process is done securely using OLE, not through plain value exchange.

### üìù Notes for Future Protocols
- ‚úÖ Use OLE as a foundation for efficient arithmetic secret-sharing operations.
- ‚úÖ ShareConversion types encapsulate the logic for secure algebraic transformations.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Always verify correctness via recombination of shares after transformation.
- üìå This pattern is crucial for protocols that alternate between additive and multiplicative operations, such as secure neural networks or multi-party arithmetic circuits.
